This code is very useful if you need to execute goal seek across a whole bunch of lines in excel at the same time.
Believe it or not this was written just before the launch of ChatGPT but honestly who cares anymore.
In order to run, you will have to run macro from the view tab in excel. You will be prompted to select a range for the "set cell"
You will then be prompted to select a range for what you want the set cells to be changed to.

Code could definitely be optimized - like better error handling especially on user interuption but c'est la vie.
